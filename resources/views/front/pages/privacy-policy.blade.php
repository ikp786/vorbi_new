            <br>
            <b>To provide and improve our Services </b>
            
            We use your information for the legitimate purpose of improving and customizing our Services for users, including sharing your information for such purposes.

            We may learn about the types of assets that you’re interested in from your browsing and purchasing behavior on (and off) the Website and use such information to suggest potential purchases as a result. As a core part of our Services, we have a legitimate interest in customizing your on-site experience to help you search for and discover relevant items and recommended purchases, including using this information to help sellers find the best ways to market and sell their listings onNaqaa.
            <br>

            Naqaa also needs to engage third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, and analytics and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and market the Services. These third parties have only limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are obligated to Naqaanot to disclose or use your information for other purposes. Our engagement of service providers is often necessary for us to provide the Services to you, particularly where such companies play important roles like helping us keep our Service operating and secure. In some other cases, these service providers aren’t strictly necessary for us to provide the Services, but help us make it better, like by helping us conduct research into how we could better serve our users. In these latter cases, we have a legitimate interest in working with service providers to make our Services better.
            
            In the event of a restructure
            
            In some cases, Naqaamay choose to buy or sell assets. Such transactions may be necessary and in our legitimate interests, particularly our interest in making decisions that enable our business to develop over the long term. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all ofNaqaa’s assets), user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Naqaaintends to transfer information about you, Naqaawill notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Website, and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt out before information about you becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

            <h2>5.How we transfer personal information </h2> 
            <p>
            When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal information in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live. For example, the circumstances in which law enforcement can access personal information may vary from country to country. Naqaadoes not participate in Privacy Shield at this time.

            <p>
            We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and after it is received, for example encryption is used for certain information (such as credit card numbers) using TLS (transport layer security). Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we can’t guarantee its absolute security. Your account information is protected by a password.

            Please note that closing your account may not free up your email address for reuse on a new account. We also retain log files for internal analysis purposes. These log files are generally retained for a brief period of time, except in cases where they are used for site safety and security, to improve site functionality, or we are legally obligated to retain them for longer time periods.
